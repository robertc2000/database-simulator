# database-simulator

The purpose of this project is to simulate a database containing tables which hold various information. The user can create a new table, delete an existing table, add rows to a specific
table and so on. There are three types of tables, depending on the type of the information it holds (STRING, INT, FLOAT). The implementation of the tables was made using Linked Lists (in C).
